Thanks for buying and supporting me. If you aren't on the email update list where I send updated versions, email zadeyhvhcsgo@gmail.com to opt-out of the update list, otherwise I will add you manually.

Here are all my new configs. Indigo calculates FOV by pixels, so if you use a lower resolution than 1080p, use the 720p configs. I usually use the "Prime" config, its a strong config for dominating against other cheaters in global, so you might  want to use the "Prime lite" or "Closet" first. Depending on your gamesense, movement and crosshair placement you can use more blatant settings without getting banned.

Have fun, Zadey.
